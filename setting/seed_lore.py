seed_lore.py -- load the Veilwrack worldbuilding into TypeDB as myth-lore.

Slices the setting markdown files into categorized lore entries (plus a few
synthesized ones) and inserts them via the mythras_gm CLI. Run AFTER
seed_veilwrack.sh:

    MYTHRAS_GM_CLI=/path/to/mythras_gm.py \
        python setting/seed_lore.py --campaign <campaign-id>

(Alternatively, skip the seed scripts entirely and load this repo with
`mythras_gm.py import-campaign --path <repo> --new-ids`.)

Generic pattern: any campaign can do the same -- write worldbuilding docs,
slice them into lore entries by category, and the GM agent retrieves them
with list-lore / get-lore during play.

ANATOMY = """## Alar Anatomy and Body Plan

The Alar are winged humanoids with a six-limbed body plan: two legs, two
arms, AND two wings (the angel configuration, not the harpy one -- arms and
wings are separate limbs, so an Alar can fight, craft, and carry while
flying).

Layout, top to bottom: a beaked, keen-eyed head; two large shoulder-mounted
wings rising from the upper back above and behind the arms; two fully
functional arms with hands; a keeled chest anchoring the flight muscle; an
abdomen; and two legs ending in clawed feet that grip and climb bone-stone
at full walking speed.

Combat consequences (avian hit location table, 1d20): 1-2 R Leg, 3-4 L Leg,
5-7 Abdomen, 8-10 Chest, 11-12 R Wing, 13-14 L Wing, 15-16 R Arm,
17-18 L Arm, 19-20 Head. Nine locations versus a human's seven. Wings are
the great tactical vulnerability: a Serious Wound to a wing (failed
Endurance contest) means no flight and triggers Grounded Dread; a Major
Wound to a wing while airborne is usually fatal at altitude. Armor doctrine
follows the anatomy: torso and head only, wings always bare.

Physique: hollow-boned and slight (SIZ -3, DEX +2 vs human baseline);
knockback against an Alar is doubled; a Flight roll halves falling distance
(arrests it entirely on a critical). Kindred variation: Vael slightest and
fastest, Roak middle-built, Ossuin +2 SIZ -- big heavy gliders built for the
long descent."""
