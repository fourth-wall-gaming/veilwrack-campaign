# Find the mythras-gm engine. Sourced by this plugin's hook and cited by its
# commands; sets GM_ROOT, GM_SKILL and GM_CLI, or returns 1.
#
# This exists because of a hard limit in the plugin system: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}
# resolves to THIS plugin's directory and there is no variable for a sibling's.
# A campaign plugin therefore cannot name the engine it depends on, even though
# the dependency guarantees it is installed. So we look, in order of how much we
# trust the answer.
#
# Two rules learned the hard way, both of which this file once broke:
#
#   1. EVERY environment variable here is expanded with `:-`. This file is
#      sourced by a hook that runs `set -u`, so a bare ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}
#      does not fall back to empty -- it aborts the caller. That is exactly
#      what happened: the probe meant to be a last-resort convenience killed
#      the search, and the campaign reported the engine as missing when it was
#      installed and working.
#
#   2. The install-tree probe must not hard-code one layout. Claude Code keeps
#      plugins in at least three shapes, and the probe below was written for
#      only one of them -- so it silently matched nothing on a real install.
